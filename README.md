## Background

Originally, this repo was created to test **Jules beta** by having it generate a simple React + Django app.

- It generated a **static React frontend** — but with **9 vulnerabilities**:
  - 3 moderate
  - 6 high
- It generated a **Django backend** that surprisingly, mostly worked out of the box — but required **manual configuration** for deployment.

## Notes on Jules

Jules is pretty good for **fast prototyping very simple ideas**.

✅ Quick to scaffold basic projects  
✅ Can get you 60-80% of the way there

⚠️ Not ready yet for production-quality apps  
⚠️ React code needed cleanup, backend required adjustments  
⚠️ I probably won’t be using it too often in its current state — but I’m curious to see how it evolves.

## Summary

- Good test of Jules beta  
- Django backend surprisingly solid  
- React frontend needed work  
- Jules is promising for very fast prototypes — but I’ll stick to writing production apps with other LLM tools for now.
